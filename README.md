# Simple Machine Learning Example

This project demonstrates the simplest possible machine learning example using **Linear Regression**.

##  What it does
The script (`simple_ml.py`) trains a model to predict house prices based on size (square footage).

It uses the `LinearRegression` model from scikit-learn to learn a linear relationship between the data points.

##  How to run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-ml-example.git
   cd simple-ml-example
